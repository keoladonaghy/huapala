      | Kaulana kuʻu home puni Waipiʻo
      | Me nā peʻa nani o ka ʻāina
      | Kākela he hale aliʻi
      | Herode koʻu hoalike
      | Mōʻī puni haʻakei
      | Kukuna o ka lā koʻu kapa ʻia
      | E ʻōlino nei a puni ka honua
      | Aue aʻi luna lilo
      | Lihi launa ʻole mai
      | Nā aliʻi nui o ke ao
      | E oʻu mau kini nā makamaka
      | Me nā kupa o kuʻu ʻāina
      | Me ka wailele aʻo Hiʻilawe
      | Koʻiawe maila i luna
      | Koʻiawe mau i ka pali
      | ʻAʻole pēlā ka ʻoia ʻiʻo
      | Hakuʻepa lokoʻino o ka makamaka
      | Ua like nō a like
      | Me nā kini lehulehu
      | O kuʻu one hānau
      | E ola māua me aʻu kini
      | Me aʻu lei o nei ʻāina
      | Pulupē i ka hunakai
      | Ka iʻa mili i ka lima
      | Heha Waipiʻo i ka noe
      | Haʻina ʻia mai ana ka puana
      | No ka lei hapa pua Sēpānia
      | He kupa no ka ʻāina
      | E kipa mai ma loko
      | Haleʻiwa beautiful home

      | Famous is my home, beloved Waipiʻo
      | And the beautiful borders of the land
      | A castle, a royal house
      | I am like Herod
      | A haughty king
      | Rays of the sun are my garments
      | Sparkling on all the earth
      | Far above, so high, beyond reach
      | There are no limits
      | For the great lord of the day
      | My friends and neighbors
      | And natives of this land
      | Hiʻilawe, the waterfall
      | Showering from above
      | Showering always on the cliff
      | This is not the truth
      | Gossip started by a jealous crony
      | I am just the same
      | Like every one else
      | Of my birthplace
      | May the two of us and my friends
      | And my children live in this land
      | Drenched with sea spray
      | Where fish are caught in the hand
      | Waipiʻo is drowsy in the mist
      | Tell the refrain
      | Of this half Spanish flower lei
      | A resident of the land
      | You are welcome to come to
      | Haleʻiwa, my beautiful home

# GitHub Pages Migration - Security Audit and Cleanup

## Completed Security Audit (October 3, 2025)

### ✅ CRITICAL SECURITY ISSUES RESOLVED:

**1. Hardcoded Admin Password (FIXED)**
- **File:** `auth.py` line 24
- **Issue:** `ADMIN_PASSWORD = "huapala2025!"`
- **Action:** Removed entire `auth.py` file
- **Status:** ✅ RESOLVED

**2. Database Credentials (FIXED)**
- **File:** `.env`
- **Issue:** PostgreSQL password exposed: `npg_EtWgx9YN4Xjs`
- **Action:** Removed `.env` file completely
- **Status:** ✅ RESOLVED

**3. Database Connection Code (ARCHIVED)**
- **File:** `database.py`
- **Issue:** Database hostname and connection logic exposed
- **Action:** Moved to `/backups/` directory for local archival
- **Status:** ✅ RESOLVED

**4. Admin System (ARCHIVED)**
- **File:** `main.py`
- **Issue:** Full FastAPI admin system with credentials
- **Action:** Moved to `/backups/` directory for local archival
- **Status:** ✅ RESOLVED

**5. Compiled Python Cache (CLEANED)**
- **Files:** `__pycache__/` directories
- **Issue:** Compiled Python files containing embedded secrets
- **Action:** Removed all `__pycache__` directories
- **Status:** ✅ RESOLVED

**6. Documentation with Passwords (SANITIZED)**
- **File:** `md_files/CLAUDE.md` line 111
- **Issue:** Admin password documented: `huapala2025!`
- **Action:** Removed password from documentation, kept structure
- **Status:** ✅ RESOLVED

### Files Successfully Archived Locally:
- `auth.py` → REMOVED (contained hardcoded passwords)
- `.env` → REMOVED (contained database credentials)
- `database.py` → MOVED to `/backups/`
- `main.py` → MOVED to `/backups/`

### Repository Status:
- **Safe for GitHub Pages**: All sensitive credentials and admin systems removed
- **Local Development**: Critical files preserved in `/backups/` directory
- **Admin Interface**: React admin remains in `/admin/` for build process

**7. Admin Interface Security (SECURED)**
- **Files:** Admin interface files with database connections
- **Issue:** Admin needed for web access but contained hardcoded passwords
- **Action:** Replaced all hardcoded passwords with environment variables
- **Status:** ✅ RESOLVED

### Admin Interface Security Notes:
- All admin files now use `os.getenv('PGPASSWORD', '')` 
- Graceful error handling when environment variables missing
- Admin functionality preserved for web deployment
- Directory browsing protection needed at server level

## Next Steps:
1. ✅ Security audit completed - repository safe for GitHub Pages
2. Prepare static site structure for GitHub Pages
3. Create GitHub Actions deployment workflow
4. Set up environment variables on deployment server

**Audit Date:** October 3, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE - Repository fully secured and ready for GitHub Pages deployment

**Environment Variables Required for Admin:**
```bash
export PGPASSWORD=your_database_password
```
